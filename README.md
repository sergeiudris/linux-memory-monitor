## Linux memory monitor

App monitors RAM usage of a process or *group* of processes (browser, database,etc.).

Solves "shared memory multiple times" problem of standard tools.

Both standard memory tools and this app read `/proc` interface, but this program goes further: it utilizes
`/proc/processid/pagemap` to connect frames (physical memory segments)  with pages (virtual memory segments),
and then filter them, leaving only unique and present (not swapped out).
